## 1. Introduction


I chose this topic since the video games industry is a fascinating look into the general cultural attitudes of a region. My plan is to track games sales over the years in correlation to their sales in specific regions as well as various changes these trends undergo over the years.

## 2. Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle, and their open source dataset repository.

Data is organized into 11 categories and spans a timeline from the early 1980s and up to 2016. However I spent a bit looking at the dataset and noticed a few errors, so I will have to go in and manually clean the more egregious ones, as well as use python to make the thing a bit easier to look at. 

## Plan

I intend to write a paper looking at the genre trends over time as well as attempt to match them to general social shifts in the respective regions where certain genres dominate the sales charts. Akin to music and art, the video game industry frequently reflects the social and cultural atitudes of an area that it is popular in.  In order to do well, I will need to write a lot report looking at these trends as well as back it up with actual analysis using python and the tool we have seen in class on some occasions.
