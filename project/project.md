## 1. Introduction


I chose this topic since the video games industry is a fascinating look into the general cultural attitudes of a region. My plan is to track games sales over the years in correlation to their sales in specific regions as well as various changes these trends undergo over the years.

## 2. Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle, and their open source dataset repository.

Data is organized into 11 categories and spans a timeline from the early 1980s and up to 2016. However I spent a bit looking at the dataset and noticed a few errors, so I will have to go in and manually clean the more egregious ones, as well as use python to make the thing a bit easier to look at. 

## Plan

I intend to write a paper looking at the genre trends over time as well as attempt to match them to general social shifts in the respective regions where certain genres dominate the sales charts. Akin to music and art, the video game industry frequently reflects the social and cultural atitudes of an area that it is popular in.  In order to do well, I will need to write a lot report looking at these trends as well as back it up with actual analysis using python and the tool we have seen in class on some occasions.

I-204 Intro to Fiction.
Manage Your Expectations (WIP)
One of the most common themes in fiction literature is that of life fulfillment and goals. This idea is present in the works we are reading as well. Both Chimamanda Adiche’s “Americanah” and Zora Neale Hurstons “John Redding goes to the sea” significantly touch upon the importance of identity and wishes in a persons life. One cannot be fulfilled if their identity is out of balance, be that due to external factors or otherwise.  
 
Chimamanda talks a lot about how important it is to be surrounded by people that you can relate to and form close connections with. We see the same thing in Hurston's work when it comes to people close to you sharing the same aspirations. John Redding goes to the Sea” touches pretty heavily upon the subject of how a community views those who do not conform to the expectations set up by the community. John's family, his employer and even his wife. This has a fairly significant impact on how John perceives what he wants from his life as a whole, frequently pointing out that he differs significantly from the norm for his town. His speech, mannerisms and worldview do not match with those of the people around him. Even though he eventually gives in and accepts certain expectations that are counter to his ideas, he still maintains the dream of going away, far beyond the sea, where he can be free of the oppressive influence of his community. This sentiment is echoed throughout Americanah as well, albeit with different targets and ideas on what a person actually desires. Ifemelu desperately wants to belong to somewhere. Having lived in the states and experienced cultures that are not her own, she clings to the ideas of her Nigerian homeland, wanting to live in a place where everything just makes *sense*.
We all cling to different symbols for our identities and goals. Either of these stories approached the topic of symbolism in different ways yet use symbols to impart a much deeper meaning than would normally be possible. In Americanah, Ifemelu hangs on to the ideals and stories of Nigeria through the symbols that hold a certain amount of significance to her childhood experiences. The scene with her getting her hair braided really translates this quite well. 
 
Both of these works touch upon the question of conformity and the effect it has on the individual in question. Its important to look at in what ways do the characters deal with conformity in their own settings.
 
A counterargument in this case would be that one can have a fulfilling life even if they conform to societal expectations and abandon their dreams of pursuing their own fate. You dont have to push boundaries to be a happy person.
